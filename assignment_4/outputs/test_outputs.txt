You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can play it as farmer, or with leather clothes, and never have chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know a epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle of the middle school, in a middle school, Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went down to bleed every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I let me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
Three years ago.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could stop Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to get stuck with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the monitored and <unk> of her family, because it was necessary, for it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed -- he had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was present in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked today about this.
It also needs -- needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quick, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around for about 60 feet of water -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or you break the ice barriers.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to hold and hold on to the end, while others can't <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> it turns out, I'm breathing your atmosphere.
As a iceberg melt away, it releases fresh water rich on minerals that feeds so many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and will not exist that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice on <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is of a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually come to see a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it does.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg from it <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg on a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop to think about the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined into the X <unk>
And in the other case, the <unk> chromosome is joined into the X X <unk>
And both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my living activity to get two <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training of training and what I study in this case is the way that people <unk> the anatomy -- that means of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics of physics doesn't fit into the male and male <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having sex that are not <unk> in the common or female form.
For example, it's the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose chromosome <unk> from the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has none of the testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in the last single course of a <unk>
When the baby <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast phones, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realized that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but actually not that way.
Women like men, like men, have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman, it doesn't know her <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> syndrome that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19-year-old born born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like a guy and just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a broken environment.
As a consequence, his genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at age 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgery, is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason for us to become a variety of surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you're presented with a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in the same body.
The most high case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the basis of judgment of the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called it to ask, "What a test is going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does not trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation in which the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought of these categories -- we thought were <unk> categories that were going straight directly into <unk> categories -- <unk> are much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which is a lot more complicated than the terminology of the <unk>
So as we see, we get into a dry terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the <unk> of the fact about them in just a few <unk>
And as we put in science in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has rights different from the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them would put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it down and she doesn't get it back.
If I stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining really someone's death, and this puts us in a hard situation that we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
We found that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
<unk> from the concept point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent relationship of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold, and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find every time looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why he happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents -- they were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did -- was a <unk> concept, and we had it done with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we would see our Parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth <unk>
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the right of the blood being passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences -- that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the story of Parents -- <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> out of the explanations for, and therefore we have the concept of power being passed on a kind of vague idea of birth <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence and they talk about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the women.
And then the success of the Civil Rights Movement of people <unk> <unk> people who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, a lot of color people who are <unk> to coincidence <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking wonder why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to deal with anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they should have sex or getting married.
There are some <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to discover what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Henry, the other thing was born in this exhibition was born March March March last March of March 1980.
And because there was only three months born before Mary was attributed to all of the rights three months before Mary -- the right to the law of sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that is not because it has a different age, but she was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now to be considered a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Mary, on their part, doesn't have the same rights as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- which in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science will go so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't test tests to people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> to <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this to give us rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know can make more intelligent <unk> choices about their sex relationships than 40 people I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where I'm going.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current way of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless you are willing to stand at a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who I talked about a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twins <unk> and then they pick them down and so <unk>
But when the phone was asked by the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, and she said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he's considered political asylum <unk> at the time of <unk> <unk>
America offers tremendous possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish the end I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there might be different ideas from different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in research on sexual relationships.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of our gender stereotypes so there's nothing feminine in <unk>
But the more I have thought about his question, more has been given to me that there is something female <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female human brain and male who makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while fathers were very attentive to find a way to protect people from the state, it's possible that to have more injected into this concept, we might have enriched the concept of <unk> with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to go to live and working, you have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new dollars to engage in a new basis.
Well, at this point, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily put it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they just went through buildings in apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would want to live in apartments were owners and the other half is still not free to get it.
They could try to increase the ability to increase the existing buildings in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have norms to avoid <unk> and the illumination of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a completely new apartment building in a whole new apartment building -- always and when the standards of that place will lead to construction instead of <unk>
So I suggested that governments -- new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk> cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform research.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests on users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say they can't go and want to go to all the current residents in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as a norms for <unk> and usually they're the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> because, in some cases, thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that would take the rules that are going out there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here on my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away into the North.
And they also make new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government -- they would need help from <unk> countries, they would benefit from the countries associated with that help them be able to establish and make the <unk> norms so that they could all trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could find a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, 19 of January, they voted in Congress to get the Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just ran through this <unk> crisis in the Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the parties, all the connections in the society, the <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February passed over again as opposed to another voting -- <unk>
Immediately after the vote of the voting on February 23, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in <unk>
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years ago -- getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> services and allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate court of the last part of this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some of a funding.
But the only thing that we know you've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free store zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would immediately change to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you, TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find myself and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is second-hand in <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The <unk> shops allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'm going to like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring with all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven peer pairs and nothing else.
<unk> to exactly one week is all I put in my <unk>
I figured it would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman that walks for TED in my underwear.  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> tiger.
You don't spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always be <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be a bad mood, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play <unk> or I remind them of the <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're okay with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see anything, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tested it again and again when people were approaching me this week simply because I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to give you everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to have emotionally <unk> to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I think.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
It can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists actually need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a form of intuition that you can have developed with the passage of the years is that one thing can be just in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking seat.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking was taught by a lesson, and it is that big things don't allow them to <unk> them and stay in a place.
This is a really big model model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really strange things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it very quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But we didn't need you to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit itself well to my logic.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in here a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal with a springboard and a springboard and that <unk> supported on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of rare things, but then when other people are going to go up with doing those things, because I don't want them to get them, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It monitors the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, there was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is that we don't want to do it at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one atom only can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic part that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was embedded in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when you take it, and we turned the lights and we looked at the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot of about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who is here and that allowed me to bring it out.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to do it with 17 museums of a few different countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explains just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, museums, in museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Now I would better show you the demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from his launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around every museum there.
There's the gallery at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite ones, the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end of the hallway you want to go at the end
They're still going forward. Have you <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in zooming around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to make it <unk>
So I began to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems like <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
So I did a little bit, I talked to some people, and I actually discovered that this is a game called the <unk> which is going to hit a <unk> with a stick with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into the depth and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you see what it is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they're Van Gogh -- actually created this piece of work.
It goes up and it really takes it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen that before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite function.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in -- I've created this function that I call the power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating of these masterpieces ...
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to their artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You did this to replicate the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it design design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened something very interesting in today's racing racing over the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career from Formula 1, it took a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good time.
If the car and the pilot was good, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, we have real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're coming back to the open air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms -- they get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw him into the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said screaming, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what don't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> <unk> on the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer.
It was the year that Italy won the World <unk>
Maybe some of you remember, played Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I finally won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at what happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river River.
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the evening early there are people here and there are doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
win Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winner and the first minister of then.
And then everybody's <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people go to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things that we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the outside of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how are it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in your shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
You're going on complicated things and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we throw not away, it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we throw one day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavioral change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is run over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public space, in public space.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you get valves from <unk> <unk> <unk> you open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with missing water.
If you fall the pixels on it, you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can look at the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
It liked a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows -- but when you're approaching it it opens so that you can actually happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is lost, like this.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get down almost the whole architecture goes down.
Here it is running.
You see the people <unk> what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to try and test the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes and you had to jump into not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use people give them to our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact -- that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels that are physical, the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with other in sync.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a standard configuration in two dimensions.
Or you know, in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the bottom of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and size, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a <unk> cloud that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with one input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best Indian dancers on today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> real-time <unk>
It can be <unk>
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone come up a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable that happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world, of the power of networks, in the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, collectively,
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from the pixel covered in the line.
You can move through it, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the major moments of the 2012 Olympics and more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> in the night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to get better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and safe than ourselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably owe the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you, that makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference. But I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
And the great $100 poet in the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense except to daylight.
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is, of course, the most interest we do.
We had a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin is not like human insulin -- but it is the same protein, that is chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the gut -- more bacteria than the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you ask you the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot, hot, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without effort in their part.
It is really like a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption of some hurry <unk> towards the end.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something more likely to be <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of cells.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into the scene of sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that is going on the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the death of the death of the body enters evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that happened, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a little light dancer.
He looks at it and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, I was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get it healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like rockets rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then we will stop the sea.
I think all of us <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality deal with my work.
I want to do it -- not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the biggest or stronger or faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, it will be <unk> by the way, and we would get ourselves so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when it <unk> planets are going to exist, the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility -- an intriguing attractive possibility and frightening.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the <unk>
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year in 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
It is not that much to make the human genome actually make the human genome for <unk> and being increasingly in the scope of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu flu on cells of a plant plants.
Can you imagine something good out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have a <unk> <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the <unk> <unk> <unk> especially if you were able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that we normally could take a thousand years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren in their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better society to make better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's selectively selectively selectively make different attributes that we want for some of us but not to <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust and <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom that we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before you could get it, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight flight.
So immediately they looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You can probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly this is not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then three words said ...
The top three words that you've heard.
He said, "You know, for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight company.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open it up.
I don't want to make anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I spent the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time you were going to go on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife with my friends, with people.
And then as a result of that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I grew up, I had the feeling of, Wow, will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in an performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk> --  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point, I understood that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the chance to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that it happens on your airplane -- and please make it not that -- but imagine, and how do you look at it.
What is it that <unk> who still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How do you change their relationships and negative energy.
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the early 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously graffiti is something <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and his cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Well, I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that you saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important to be important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Anybody seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way -- they're marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with just a check, and rather than that he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how he was going to be <unk>
I was obsessed with her brother and his father there at that very moment, "All right, <unk> is going to talk right, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on their inside can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw over that and record the negative space.
So they're going out there making art facilities like this.
All the things that they do, they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First they start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, with the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And a couple of years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization moving the things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One one, touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine to prove to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken out the frames of the walls and instead would have been <unk>
But for two weeks -- we were going to go into the <unk> shipping camp, and my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of <unk> sunlight that we bought in the <unk> System of Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera -- we put a <unk> camera, we put it on an infrared light, and now there's a device that is free -- we published the code -- we published the software <unk> the software is low in a free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we go back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of training all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of a parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti too.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time it was drawn in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came up to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> went from the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, and Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of Los Angeles to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
It's going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, it would happen.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at some point.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something, and I had wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that you need to do -- if it's not right now, we will save -- and if I am not me, who is that <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very hard and at the same time as dangerous as dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It advertised in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been focusing on situations in such awful situations with the only goal to try to examine social questions in ways that <unk> attractive, and hopefully analyzing a way that would be useful and accessible and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some Facebook messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights on the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be done in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do it.
But said this, this is a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would have had no <unk> for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I stood in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to make me anything so dangerous or so dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I tried to do about the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all over top at the bottom, it has brand, it has brand, all the time -- from the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, we have <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were trained by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> That's what? <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the X <unk> sponsors in the title, but we're going to make sure that we would take all the categories that we could on the film.
You may have a shoe, and it becomes the greatest shoe that you've <unk>
The most cool car you've driven in "The largest <unk> ever <unk> the greatest drink you ever <unk> you <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the marks as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> makes it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the <unk> is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny that I hear you, it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> people are going to be there.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're going to be very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half a <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth trying to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that film will come to us as a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think about going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to be <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I got <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. Open <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the landscape of separate media -- it's not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no error at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line -- maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when you try to make it something changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was a bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want them to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's him looking at him as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and there's history <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the middle and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- and that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big, big, giant films and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood film movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I get to step out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say you're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to tell you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there I offer you one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> and <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much a man like for <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of small movies that we have, we are more good a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind the people are the reason why this is why we're interested in.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Woman: Great <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold OK.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
You keep it cool.
How do you stay cool with better <unk> better than <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the street, the people like me, the <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray walls, and so many gray things.
I'm usually wearing accessories as sun sunglasses, or like the crystals and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of that <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of <unk>
<unk> toys for pets on the country and the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I can often be <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What is the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> what does that apply to us?
What phase is <unk> What phase is you find now?
Why is it important?
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a few more than you -- that's not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)  Thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only being poured into one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually go back and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands and those things that have gone and come up with but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity up, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more of a <unk> attribute of it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystical like <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're sophisticated <unk> like <unk>
You're a traditional place, traditional, <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're sure. stable, familiar, reliable familiar, sure, sacred, <unk> or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film to film.
We went to San Paulo where they are forbidden from advertising <unk>
In the entire city over the last five years, there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting way in the schools with available problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects I have in the most answer or the ones that I've been more successful is the ones that I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies are not my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did they have gone? they succeeded.
Well, since the film was sent back into the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out, in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million dollars on the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win lead.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies we talked about will tell their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get the risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think that when you get people out of that are pushing them into failure.
I think that when you train your employees at the loss at risk is preparing their entire company to be preparing for rewards.
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it place to fear.
We have to put that bear in an cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep the transparency.
Today, a little bit of honesty is going to go around a long way.
And that said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> has been introduced by my good friends to <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: And so we had a <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my support for next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that are controlled speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus on Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the <unk> nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part -- <unk> multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very odd things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat that he didn't like our <unk> that wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then of experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Make it better than the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the seizure code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed armed with people that obviously had all the internal information.
Do you all have the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it would take the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language of language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning, were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage with the real world with potential world targets in the real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that a violent <unk> must definitely be a violent <unk> and it's certainly in Iran because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of <unk>
rotor is that little mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can be able to do it and even make <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had in our hands.
It wasn't just like this.
The results have been from several weeks of working work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> were to just one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- I really would get back.
There's the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values for example, of the sensors, for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on <unk> video.
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is going on, you have to open bone tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we are going to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has been public on many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills or another one that makes users of wheelchair get up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big strength, which is also increasing your speed, and help, for example, managing the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other technological things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back to a <unk> load of <unk> and it's going to be <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in <unk> injuries on the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- the chronic care of my back.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldiers: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can be <unk> 300 pounds per variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of wheelchair chairs on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people standing up on all lawn chairs all over the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of this.
We talk about something that happens frequently, very young people who have damage to the spinal cord to start their life -- at 20, 40 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that takes them through this quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from the successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had a spinal cord injury and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> on the crutches that they send signals to board, on board, here on the back.
And there are a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, for a weird jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all this movement from shattered down down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the bottom in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and talk to you.
It is in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but how Amanda, and all the users of all chairs all the way to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the New York festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> Bonobos in forests in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living relatives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big <unk> <unk> the Bonobo society, is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades, and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation makes you not fill in a stadium or a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the lives of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is critical to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo sees the roots very <unk> same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual.
Play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> ball game and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in Bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows you the invention of bringing physical elements to play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time it's about the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to make this -- this is a young woman, who is playing with a little bit of water.
I think that as it, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get to the most of our <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like to play, they can be the moments as the most urgent thing is <unk>
So in the way, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and try to play together while we were by creativity, the friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a fire of <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are raising a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and she <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer I had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go into and save the dog owner of the owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, over the rest of his life, would have to tell the people who came into a call building to save a live <unk> just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but I got on the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire firemen and went to the <unk> and the more they had just finished on the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back into the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house to the house owner where, as you would expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner <unk> for the brave effort to get her home.
The kindness she looked at the rest of it was that somebody had ever had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as on my calling as voluntary firefighter -- I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of <unk> and courage acts of the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It's all about importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made -- or they're because of the remarkable success of success I'd like to remind you this: no wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, I'm going to talk now.
They were food in a dining room, and they put a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: <unk> Mark, Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement with a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He called her <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that the more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply took the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world, stacked over others to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally didn't realize that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're attached through magnets.
So you can't get the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the pink is the stream, the pink and the orange of orange is the wire and the orange of the orange thing.
So you only have to assemble a blue blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue one with a green one is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower, it's just going on this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've led to children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronic electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> the designers from Rhode Island School of Rhode Island to have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper, and we said, Make something like that.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> barrel turned into motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So let's go ahead and forth.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> just take a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue better we leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm like time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to do, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We took a few members every year and we put them working with <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World -- we send them to the wild world <unk>
They worked with great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it shows you as if I were looking at a quote, but what you really search for is that somebody has been caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good to put fires when it is covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for the help of this <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment that I would spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more more than the citizens who were <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
When you do so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can tell you.
I mean, it has a single component of it.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government is.
And it goes viral.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> in the tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why he asked the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been taken off to get people to get out to clean sidewalks up when he <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we would use using it.
And this has been spread out <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit about government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> acquisition usually takes a couple of years ago.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that that they made by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the Washington state of California that until the time 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has been program for a couple of days and this is <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways of working, not like private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather than the Internet.
I mean, no <unk> in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way the government to deal with the question of the government that has the new <unk> not like a problem of <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're really good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given on the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we just leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put together, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because they alone don't exist.
Now a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to get it, because things are changing.
<unk> is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately grows from us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people I thought the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of information and services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the foundation of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the doors of the house, put music hard and see if it comes out.
It worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has a web and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't make that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration with distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen to have a <unk> <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to pick up a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will expand our values and we understand our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and the politics is the <unk> superficial layer.
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us in that that we actually have this kind of an operating thing that is operating in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make bureaucracy as sexy.
Because that's where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a bunch of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have been faced with government, it's time that we ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
We have to see massive challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of the government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act on, just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a larger generation of a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will speak.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem doesn't care a lot of to do to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set the work to work in order to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage dump that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or will we also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here have impact all over the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
So here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and watching it, she was approaching me and I gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then tell me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and I was like, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I took back again, and if he said yes, I was allowed to peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of the 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get their time and your attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother.
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and she was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he took me through the room, and he said, "Come <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Only I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask you, is that you always want to get your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to get it out there that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that I'm always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So do you <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I did it.
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, and I have a brother, a older year and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just get to make <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing as we do.
And I already took something, your sister too.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can get it."
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went on the gaze with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother really believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My guys died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find as much <unk> as much despair.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Philadelphia, French Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, for 50 to 60 percent of all the young people of color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system, which is much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And we seem to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good developments curious.
In my state in Alabama, as in other states, as in other states, you care about the rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right <unk>
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world of 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, without chance to come out there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way that we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not to decide whether people deserve to die by crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified that he's innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death <unk>
A rate of error, you would have an innocent one of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation is not allowed to never fly airplanes from every nine that you would have to be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students in history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the rebuilding of the reconstruction of the rebuilding of the rebuilding of the World War.
We actually don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you will say, <unk> <unk> and <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, no, we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of those, race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would have one other time.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we've never done it.
I was in Germany to talk about death row
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quiet silently and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
Let's think about this.
How do we believe ourselves in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not tell them.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
We think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> because of suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, it needs to integrate both of them.
Recently we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that is inside of us.
We have to believe that we have to believe that we've never seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With creativity. The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also on the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an willingness to be on places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, is still in communities like TED, it should be <unk>
There is no <unk> disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> the inequality of injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege -- being a young lawyer who was to meet Rosa <unk>
These women would gather just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to bring them together to speak.
Do you want to come and get back.
I would say, "Be lady. I know I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion that I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty <unk>
We try to reduce the population in jails.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and at the end of it, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got up, put me his finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> on simple things.
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever had.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
And I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful -- very beautiful, very <unk> you don't judge ourselves by our technology, by our designs, and for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way the rich powerful, powerful and <unk> but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years that have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge judge someone who isn't it?
The judge would play it as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at night, and I was awake in my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14-year-old customer a little, black <unk>
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my age of 14 years to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> by a <unk>
In the <unk> I started that there were been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
And for my horror, not only had anybody sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court this case, stupid.
I got on the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. He said yes.
So I came up with me and I get stuck.
And I got married in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deep to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I <unk>
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the prosecutors the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. They're all infuriated because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and let me hear all that <unk>
I walk down here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with a head of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break for a <unk> <unk> he was upset because the <unk> had entered in the room.
The <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man who would keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come today at TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
What our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to you to hear and see a clear point of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to make a sense of <unk> the funds they spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're spending a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases of homicide <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited to be excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can be solved.
And as nothing we care about to survive, the first stop for all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us damage.
So this is why we have a <unk> story to look the negative things.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood -- <unk> is very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, is no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the weather extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we do.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we ended up with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita adjusted by inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has gone down 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has spent 25 to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do that.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, no television, mobile air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It was a lot of technology -- and then then we have this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in a recession, in a recession, and on the rise.
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law to the left, it goes up up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call the infinite 3D <unk> and the data of democratizing and distribute personalized production all over the planet, biology, synthetic biology, fuel fuels, and vaccines and food, digital medicine and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> to themselves; humans."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which may be positive will positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can today impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that one that's scarce and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
You took dinner to dinner the king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops had covered <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the end of Washington Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as a <unk>
We had this analogy for the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that are about 5,000 times more energy than we use in one year.
They get to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about thin, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, electricity will cost six cents an hour, compared to 15 cents on national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after he passed on.
I had a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yeah, the <unk> is saltwater, the two percent of the water is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes this nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge ...
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any source source, <unk> water, <unk> water -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke has just seen a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that you will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation of this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration of mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music, the diagnostic technology is now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce to the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to be able to go through these technologies in a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can extract blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world that there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we wouldn't be able to call the health of the health, and first of all, avoiding the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just pass the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll move from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before they add up to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What a <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and due to the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we have three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
What about some voices never before.
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for <unk>
What do these three billion <unk>
And if they are contributions we cannot <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided teams by his passion with a goal, of course, can do things that were previously able to do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with an university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people got joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that the pattern of human patterns recognition machinery is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today as people to take big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative <unk> passion for <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we have to be told to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute before I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it so much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates the other concept: the shifting of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 a.m., the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was made more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went at five centimeters.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose countries that already had 100,000 words: <unk> industrial fisheries.
And this boat pretty ugly, it's called The <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the southern China Sea South China, and mostly in the Ross Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny spots on some of the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then starts commercial fishing begins.
The bottom line is going to be a solid bottom of this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to go back, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that fishermen are collected whenever they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
I don't remember.
They took the point of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things called biodiversity, number of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and would extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And in the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killed by killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very abundant before you <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose rare animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focused on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence introduced in a very early way is not the way they would expect that evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us may like Captain such as captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used -- or typically they don't use the scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources.
Hence the huge role that it can achieve a protected area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been running and it's extremely low.
That's for people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their point of place.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be filling the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were just touched by the film, I will talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
That's why we're going to see why videos are made up and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web is making any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
There are over 48 hours of YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is viral for lots and lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and very surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the views in the rise of popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not to write a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double bow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would bring to the video to be very popular.
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> presents us with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  He's on a Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everyone wants to come on Friday.   You all want to go on Friday. <unk> on a Saturday <unk>   I wouldn't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
The Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this day Friday <unk>
Well, he took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends embrace a view of view, and they share with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great light joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a <unk> version that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that aroused among the Internet community <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then international made up.
All of a sudden, arose a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Black <unk>
What script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up for minute, just that only one thing and unexpected can be done in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a <unk> protest against <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't interested in too much there.
Casey <unk> I would have no circular amount of <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you out properly on the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> I got five million people to see and understand her idea.
So this is worth this approach to all the new thing that we make in creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, all unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- of a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old old media, it's barely the means of the current media -- but we would have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now we would get it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My homework was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that the story was to learn that I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls were dead.
For her, life had been destined to be a <unk> task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat was thrown into the dressed of his dressed ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the unconscious, the rape and death.
Like most of the adults -- my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were asked first we would have my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start to start six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, I would go in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to make a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from.
Unlike the suburbs of middle class, whose existence of me <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
<unk> that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then on a car assembly line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title on IT in the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, it doesn't matter what it should be <unk> which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A uniform uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, in what?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating in determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to wake up until his nightmares started to be able to get it out.
She opened a grocery store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do mad transition and <unk> and <unk> guys stuck between two worlds.
They were <unk> and <unk>
And they have been centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the classical child student relentless with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically fighting for violence, substance abuse, and isolation.
But a lot of they got aid through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of Law, I chose the young Australian officer of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges are not <unk>
There was so <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and a social activist -- invited to talk on places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the tables and the happy life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk>
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got up the boat.
There was never a choice.
<unk> he said, "What is not what we don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking about, the more I was to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what <unk> living on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, new back at the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism and a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who actually <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> to the evening.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some shiny ones, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause of myself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be made to be wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel room when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing around the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
And at night a monk came up and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of the people who we were and how life built us up now we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> it easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, courageous diving in every wave, the <unk> rhythm of the engine, vast horizon that doesn't guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time, when I was born, the great prince experienced Indian warrior -- he was <unk> he pulled out a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And I was very pleased with that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get it to my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic, not <unk>
And my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the cameras of luxury and cameras prevent it <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came back to this technological world to see how it would be able to make magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
You put the text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that apply to us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  he says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back with a character from the book.
In several times it comes to a <unk> -- the iPad knows where you live through the GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but the magic of childhood, those ideas that they were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was about a girl was that a whole galaxy.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor people have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back to a child child story.
In a story which is current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't have it.
So to take this early ritual of childhood, you have to go out in a chapter, and then we would bring a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
In the variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology to come up to the other.
It monitors the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves in the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little coffee cup or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk> What about <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us -- or maybe not all of us, but most of our <unk> projects, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi metric. It's a very simple thing.
It's got a jet on and closed down.
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's just so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that you need to care for you, or a urgency of that style is to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing it can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can lead to the people of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people who are <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back into control and being captains for their own <unk> but also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients with the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have controls navigation in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATM <unk>
Where are you all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
And we created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please call it <unk> where, and when it is open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their <unk> cell to find the nearest <unk> what it can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
He also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be text services or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please, <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera that was in planning was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by controlling the <unk>
It would be like this: an construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
And so you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
Is it the details or the <unk>
Will light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still seems like <unk> as if we exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those in which we don't even understand the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But when I combine some pictures it's very important to do, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of different places.
In the personal one, I think it's easier to create a place that is just because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made red the house of the top of the island for more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think we need planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures, the result can be very beautiful and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> it's something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology <unk> on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw the drawing on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to put on the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say much.
But if you do that, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives rise to <unk>
If the technology of transportation is as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But they don't go to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is is -- look at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or it will be in a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is to ask myself, "What is that new shape <unk>
What's new state runs the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been spent year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
So a transformation. Can you feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how it might be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back to about two and a half two billion years when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals that we would go around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals together, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. So I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at the time, I had floating around oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that did incorporate materials from the outside and the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were <unk> cell forms <unk> those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get older, you get a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we get.
That's why every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets of some way will be better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemists -- more chemists and more <unk>
They were usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple chemistry, but things are really interesting when these blobs learned the trick of the abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this endless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that try to hide the security people at the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA, and we would take it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card I've got a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things were going on very different, and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information in the cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's plenty of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to get communities which, in a way, were together in fact, and set up a <unk>
In that <unk> or <unk> it would be that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have <unk> communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscle cell or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and they had more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in the community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible <unk> structures to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because she knew bad and sick and sick of her ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that have been built for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit processing.
So the fact that the nervous system built into those data structures is enormously an evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the necessary time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea in my head.
I'm here emitting a little bit of <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in his heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
Now that allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to make <unk>
We now spend a similar amount of periods of the <unk> organisms, our flight methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer -- the <unk> tape -- the <unk> the <unk> are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And so they aggregate us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next language, the language, and so on, they took less than a million years.
And then back and forth, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that job <unk> would not be possible without the recent online advances.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to focus on a conventional fashion.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that I couldn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we need methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, more extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random at random, running all those programs, and take those more people to get into what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say that I want to just end numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a random random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
They would take those and forth to the rest.
And now we would get the best things to do with the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, and we have <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will take the properties of both of these programs.
So we get a new generation of product programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We put some mutations in.
And it tries again and tries to get another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that sequence numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than the ones that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
These are dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the target because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
And once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're getting complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
We don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs so quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing gets faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog time by the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we have requested 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base, it didn't get to time, and the second base is going to be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 <unk> I'll hit you.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League of Women's League -- to run more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now let's get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are matched to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place off and a dear to <unk> has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record is 200 dollars.
But you know what?
She's getting better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But will you ask them.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a nurse <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I was included, with the mandate of being perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Sachs until a blood test.
How about that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> apartment in the General at the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> is the branching out of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> differential diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And I get out of medical school with the impression that if you were to go through it, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist I would go to that patient.
And inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would give her.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave them <unk> water pills so that I could get liquid <unk>
And at an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring back information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who would give constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inner voice that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't think so.
In fact, I was so unsure that I asked the nurse that I would <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to utter <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance with the ambulance with the ambulance for her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't really do normally, I did a lot.
It went through the emergency room at home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that I had a lady <unk> before, but another one, he said to me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors were born.
Other specialists fear it too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the surgical patients.
The three words are: right?
<unk> from the patient who sent to his <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her the high school, he suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock shock means.
I was just breathing and blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to climb the blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then that <unk> was in intensive care, and waiting for all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days the next one was obvious that I never did.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together together.
And in eight or nine days, they would get to what was happening.
And on the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was inspired by this and experienced for the first time <unk> that exists in our medical culture and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that healthy <unk> because you can't fit with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame <unk> that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> He was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would do the things and made sure that I didn't give up.
And I followed those questions.
Why didn't I tell my <unk> Why was he sent to your home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Gradually, that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened the sky and finally the sun came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were to get the efforts to be perfect to make no more errors, make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an undergraduate morning in the emergency hospital in a Northern <unk> in Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door, he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it goes top, and it can cause the close to those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back to work, until again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, and especially working in a hospital, because they would be used to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't have sent home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague who was checking a certain sensitivity that was checking some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read this liquid to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
And I looked at it, and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered as well.
But every single case I was obsessed with me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get a little bit and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show them that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital had broken up the wrong leg, you trust her that I'd have a hard time looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which are actually making mistakes and what I know; those who can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get away from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about <unk> journalism, I've done a personal medical support study and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the first paper that I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every day, in which one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system in which infection infection is increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, to die of medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so the things are.
A self-organizing system where knowledge is blown away every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in my chest, and it comes out with <unk> eyes and breath to alcohol and suddenly my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars, and they don't want their symptoms always the same way.
That's why the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals of error, well, you will not get anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, this is my worst <unk> blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and started counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> being able to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The humanitarian doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their errors, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They were taking their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We prescribe the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and to support them for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, we're going to make mistakes happen.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we took one day to do.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half American American is about 70 a day.
Not long ago in a research followed by a week in a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks made by these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your election.
You know how many people belong to the middle category, and how many of the <unk>
How do they grade the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to choose to be <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and with some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I make a question, as I am blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this at a very, very sophisticated level, at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 <unk> water, and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was able to ask myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is a shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> trees.
And once I decided to go to a manager and I asked him, "Do you have this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the one.
<unk>
They had a different kind of different classes.
He put a put on the entrance to the store.
We put out there six <unk> or from 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a year ago that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
Of the ones that stood up when six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times a chance of buying <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> -- less is good to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices will affect us in good decisions.
We decided to decide, even when it doesn't get us wrong.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the savings savings for about a million Americans, from about a million Americans, between about 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds make available business plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, was less participation.
So if you look at the extreme extreme, we see that in the <unk> plans for <unk> was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about <unk> the rate of participation went down to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people are committed to avoid stocks or investment.
As soon as the more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three negative consequences of getting to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely it is to make the decision, the decision, even though this is against the self-interest.
We are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things out of <unk> even though objectively the better.
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to do that today -- four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, less than it is.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of your strange options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, you will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Arab Arab corporation eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they get increased <unk> in <unk> by two and older sales and lower costs.
You know that the supermarket bank is now offered 45,000 products.
In a tent, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce out.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard show.
All of the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safety of life.
Who really wants to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk> either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience with a little holiday with all of paid to the world's <unk>
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to go back, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply supply for you.
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really would hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first turn, than in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they need to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make people more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to the meeting that we would see exactly how it was <unk> we made a little bit of <unk>
What we added was that we would give them to the staff who would think about the positive things they would take in his lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a classroom of magazine made.
We saw that in the retail <unk> in the middle of the <unk> the computer exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Okay, so there's a few.
If you think the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something about who we are going to do, not the ones that we do.
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
You're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just have a little bit.
We have to increase incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a <unk> decision that they buy a car.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box, four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions happen.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go for a few choices, four <unk> in 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do that?
What you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and more.
They were <unk>
If you go out of a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Now if you pick the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help handle the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who do their jobs.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful we're in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the East Germany, if you had a typewriter it must be <unk> in front of the government.
And I had to record a text leaf by written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think somebody could do this, how much this would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and printing a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own and on your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, large amounts.
There are actually a lot of online online cases where they would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bank accounts.
The U.S. secret -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be the victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of suicide in terms we observe today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, the protests, they motivate them to them, motivate laughter.
Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the national and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
It took the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with representative government, asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack on the attack.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority authority.
And that was called <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt the headquarters for the secret secret police headquarters in April, 2011, and during the building, in the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among the papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, tools to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the authoritarian government.
The <unk> headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to allow governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by officials in the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
It is <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's on play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right, any right that we're going to use today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, I live in Kenya, in the south of Australian National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead in the morning, because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to protect them, and why we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and are also annoying to the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that they killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, six to nine years old, is responsible for cattle.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions give them fear.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't think <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions to believe that he was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So she jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch.
And this is a little bottle of a <unk> <unk>
They would take everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses would have heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
I've put them installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to frightening other predators, and it's also using it to save elephants from the farms.
Thank you this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends into my community and install lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes to me and said that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come on plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions here.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close electrical <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that fences were already invented -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it once, once, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> out of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step that I would get my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little boy, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would have spent my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When you put this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at her face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned to take care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine would go to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy breaks all around me was completely entirely on dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just across the river from my house.
I always asked why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I get out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 to go back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like the refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants from China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of the North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was headed on the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it wasn't natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to each other, "This was a fake report.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> had eventually released away after a strong international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, everybody can be able to get it in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to risk going to South Korea to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call out with me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent to my family, and as he said, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to immediately flee away.
So I started planning on how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took one flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese -- I had to put it somehow, for over 3,000 miles to China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked for everybody else's identification and started asking them.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I stood up and I said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We made all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards the guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After <unk> <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money to my family, and for another two North America and <unk> them.
I took my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I am not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The slightly unknown stranger would have a new hope for me and for the village to be able to spend the other thing about it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and support of the international community is really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of language -- language, of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in touch with family still inside, and we send information and money and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help giving North Koreans an opportunity to thrive an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern
This is <unk> stores of <unk> <unk> fast <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Central Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles by -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong with the city.
This is Los Angeles South Angeles -- <unk> <unk> fast <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Southern <unk> home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to kill more people killing more people in the car.
People are dying of infectious disease in Los Angeles Southern
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of house you see the effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see lawn chairs and sold as a car <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I already got tired of how to drive 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine <unk>
What we do, we are kind of paid for gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got on top of me and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> made reverse order.
And I was like, "Come on, right?
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And then I was like, "Well, do it."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk> land.
It's got 68 miles off <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plant plants.
Why on earth does it not seem like this?
<unk> a plant will give a few, 10 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Just like an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what earth is able to do if they leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It's going to be able to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad enough to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who was so close to hunger -- and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people will steal your <unk>
And I say, "For God no, I am not afraid you go to <unk>
So it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to get her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, to give me their stories about how this had affected us and how they used to plant with his mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people coming from, and they work and <unk> all in the volunteer.
If kids are growing up <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If I grow cereal will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind to what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're stuck. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, which is not taking them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who were charged with their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the <unk> we never will.
Now this is one of my plan that I want to do.
I want to plant all a block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't get stuck.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to get people working on the people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners will be.
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You can take them to take their <unk> right?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and get meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come in the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on asphalt that we can see.
And especially if you go on the <unk> and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt is able to make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road on a quiet street.
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, in most of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water water flow over the sides and will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and you don't get water out of it.
Noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, it's all the noise of it, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that on this road the stones on the surface are gone.
First of all, a stone, then a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see the damage to the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you're <unk> they're going to become <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will get the <unk> you see the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel, from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> of steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially the steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are moving back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine to <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven. It's a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts for several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then we put them together with our <unk> machine, and we put them back into it.
We can do this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even they can reduce the life of the surface -- you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to get cool first before I can show you how it does make the repairability work.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where it would be.
We had to hide books on shopping bags so it looks like we were shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they know about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
One total <unk> of a remote province in a remote province in that his daughter, my mother, was to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother raised a master's degree.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his entire family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still don't want to be <unk>
I have 22 years today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I found myself here proud to graduate school, College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He doesn't only get out of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who has been driving it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, even though they are still in front of a opposition machine?
As a <unk> it's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went off the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes.
When you get to your house, the phone is a voice to pick her out that if he was following his daughter to school, they would go and try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I won't hurt the future of my old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people -- there is a parent who recognized her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would argue that these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retirement of American troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see a <unk> future and climate change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- <unk> and every day, the girls in <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother's who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've been almost two years since the revolution broke down by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a <unk> day and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the middle, they were at the middle, the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to deal with the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a <unk> period, a brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of our society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a inclusive transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded <unk> <unk> leaders, the <unk> of women, a women's <unk> leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right of engaging in a democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly becoming more <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
With time, our initiative is getting a successful <unk>
Women won an <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and ancient <unk>
Another day we would start with the news from the murder of the murder <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of murder U.S. officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their peers, of the human rights of the prisoners and their lack of the law.
Our society, made up a revolutionary mindset, it gets longer, and it has become away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> the <unk> and revenge became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here at all in order to <unk> our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like for women?
Maybe what was missing were not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the election needed -- that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of women's more than need the representation of <unk> and we used to use it.
We need to stop acting as radiation agents, and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but it will also put <unk> instead of <unk> instead of the society, collaboration instead of competition instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately need to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known for all the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans the whole humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have been <unk>
And so, as the uterus covers completely the <unk> <unk> that grows inside, the right matrix of compassion <unk> all of us.
This is what it tells us to us, "My mercy is it going on all the things."
This is what it tells us to us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That to everybody else is <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a hopeful question, which has an equally inspiring answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that they all do. Why do she have this left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had had no <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would get my head to a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, who I loved one in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. which is a <unk> love trap. where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> <unk> list between them -- Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I have almost 20 years from married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, every single income education and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships and <unk> or <unk> or, in another way, in families, the last place where we would want or or we would expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who would sit with a man who hits him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States of between 16 and 24 years of age, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls at that age are killed every year by partners, and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning warning or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just had a <unk> university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the most impressed me in that first encounter was he was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> like blocks, and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning of the beginning of a <unk>
We started to go out and loved all of me, and I loved all of me, that she had gone to Harvard, who would put friends in helping girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York, and I would leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I wanted to quit my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was inside a head in a physical trap and a psychological trap and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts with.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to feel so safe I bought three <unk>
One one was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed these guns to cause the trauma to a little lived in a small life.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never got my hand, I was really serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend suit from my mother and married him.
Despite what happened, I was confident that I was living happy for always, because I loved him, and he wanted a lot of a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was simply a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident, and I would never have any harm.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would get several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he was pulled through the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was reminded when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three Americans is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control means that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly strong man, and he was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get paid.
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have the victims, we know something that you are usually <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has finally been able to make their own relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, and it was to be manipulation of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still ask why why don't you just go?
I was able to go, because of one last year, beating my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family friends and <unk> and I'm here today because all of you would get stuck.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims of the victims like <unk> <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who are also afraid they learned a lesson from what happened to them, and that they would save their lives joyful lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence very typical of violence.
I became marrying with a man who was <unk> and kind and have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have more than ever else, would be a <unk> <unk> to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, the same is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time, I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my <unk> crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They took the abuse of the light to light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
Do you see their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow consciously, to slow down your climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel like this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have me like this.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothes on a stage <unk> so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but figure it out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These aren't very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater around the head, because it's when they're going to laugh for me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why do I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance of it is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer told me that I would raise the back and I would get the hair from the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial tan -- like the one that I made two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how are it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I have known to harness them to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown by <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that you get. Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is to be a model when we grow up.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I would really tell you to each one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this <unk> list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I know I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be <unk> <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the surgical surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you run your studies, and you have a script and some work on your back, no matter what I think you want to be president of the United States -- but your test <unk> you want to be president of the United States for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually every photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told -- and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering a personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is what it looks like with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in the journal <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a professional group of professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too much a three-inch heel. I have to use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and I was given the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> got a light light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges <unk> because I don't know what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent of the teenagers were black and Latino women, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me.
But how many times am I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number got up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is what you like.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with some smaller legs and the most brilliant hair, I will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the most brilliant hair, but it's probably the very most <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation for racial oppression and gender and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If you have something to hold of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was really passionate enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 more photos -- and I didn't get them to them.
There was no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum amount on lighting.
In fact, most of tourists are random.
My story begins with the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and the 5.
And so we happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to take us out of a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has ever met with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week in October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in every single way.
Because, while we got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he was stopped in dry and pointed to a red <unk> of the <unk> supply store.
And he described me what it was about five years old in the same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart would be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't get out of many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to get closer to somebody and ask him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most popular birds group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter from <unk> as a stupid <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't know. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't remain clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in <unk> like <unk> and the <unk> and the West <unk> -- where we have 16 species at age 16 11 and a high risk of extinction.
So why are we <unk> they're important to be important, they provide vital vital services -- <unk>
They're the <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to bone.
They help killing all the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that it wouldn't be for them would stretch and caused large losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unity between the United States and under Egypt.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, some really important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or <unk> to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, and what it means is that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge amount of time bomb for <unk> The number of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, and so focus on a commercial problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with the governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you would tell them about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw it with no effort, without <unk> in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life -- has been to be <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We talked to the 21, which Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would do, you know.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach the people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got to seed seeds to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local local tomatoes and we teach them and and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested who were interested in doing that, so they gave them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were beyond the local in so fertile valley, they had no agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> for time to save the people in Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato sauce, to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, why do we not have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? You're never <unk>
I thought we only have Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English was doing, and then to see what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that gave them to <unk> people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are an <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root -- which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if I were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal deal with all of a different culture as if I were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference was put a cane on the ground and said, <unk> you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to take the 27 years to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It gets to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people from the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a pub. We came together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give him an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not in meetings in their communities.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified.
So, planning has this point of point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the business doctor in the business -- that it sets up with you in your house, at the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city Australia in Western Australia ...
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this <unk> garbage where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I was <unk> and <unk>     So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business psychology of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before in business, and this is what Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss from the death of the business.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you a little bit of mind, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about you more than this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- not renewable <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There's no technology to do it.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> they got together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York City.
So what happens? For the next 40 years, in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States -- <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you to <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute absolute -- dedicated to <unk>
And then later -- you'll have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company -- the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the research and looked at the 100 of the world's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all new companies Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
Never the word I, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars in bars along with their dedicated comrades who are going to do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, what <unk>
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can see it. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us with a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask for more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that they take shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That always comes to the music.  There's a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live near this home and thought how it could turn it into a rather pleasant space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and she was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And it made me a profound gratitude for the living time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things in my life today.
But I want to keep this look at my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to grow up the day and to forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this home house on a giant board and painted on her sentences to <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I had to die I want to be on trial for <unk>  Before I died I want to sit down, I would sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to get married once more."
Before I died I want to go to the rescue <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes and hope for people laughing at <unk> and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to <unk> the reflection and the <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
That's why with my colleagues in the middle of the civic center, we made a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in raise, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
Think of the death of the death of your life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
We don't speak, but it's transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> pass what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and notice this has never been <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to be a word that I couldn't even think of, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the more <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I came out every year when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm for the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the notion of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them within it, it could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that are increasing in the world, there's no cause no cure or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies -- and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it was more different, and the differences were more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child that sees the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could give you a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be remarkable.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness the progress and the shift dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what should have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State teacher asked me, a professor of communications -- I gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown ones.
But when you develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when she fell down the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just so I felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment and health care health issues, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care of the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as being <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate clearly your science without compromise the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They're a lot of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> do -- the bullets are killed, and they give them their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's kind of spread too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
In contrast, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then to provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key keys that can help the rest open, the door and look at the country of the wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words about the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public charge no matter -- platform or first, and that, when he wins, he gets it out of the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words they were told in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They got her on the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London to won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
Didn't you know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This will be done in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the People in the United States.
Not very <unk>
Some would just call it <unk>
They thought it was about proven quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could have chosen King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
All the world got tired -- <unk> because this debate will be done for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
It caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of you didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call King for whether he gave him to him or his finest ideas.
So, they wanted to give it the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and the most <unk> that you have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to signed up and meet with <unk> <unk>
And who is taking on serious <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't survive.
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never had for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to stay there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, I want to tell you that the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and <unk> and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness of then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to give you to you.
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and use the reality, but really, really change a lot more changes than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a northern mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> from heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like others, I wear a cheap firefly <unk> he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches that they hold the walls of that hole in a meter which drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
She <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> meters in that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are at depths of that hole at the risk of their lives without paying a reward and, often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do that, because they're prey in slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Rio Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not in such a grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was really curious about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me kind of like the stomach and a weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them may be considered my second home.
But this time, I would take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much of the African Africans during the whole issue of slave slave all the time.
150 years ago, the cost of a year's slave was about three times the annual salary from a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of <unk>
However, today you can support entire families by generations per generations of <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery takes profit from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods of slaves have value, but those who are producing are disposable things.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet, it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like to go into the old Egypt or the <unk>
They went on at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, families -- entire families -- entire families -- <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee stations -- no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just quite <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot to touch it, and she stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my very quickly side and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizens of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and trusted that he <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas in the Himalayas I found children carrying stones for miles per <unk> terrain to trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were happier than the kids that had the <unk> and the children would put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness I told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I grew up women who had been previously previously <unk>
It was driven by a few steps that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution.
They have small, private, private, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their <unk>
From foot in <unk> I remember making sense of a acute acute fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> to the stairs where I <unk>
There was no secret doors.
There were no windows for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because they touch a very hard issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year like sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and thrown the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
You still can get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> <unk> in Lake <unk> the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids -- it makes sense of it?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with a topic that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> in Lake <unk> and they often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, you get into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work in the lake.
For fear of their love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
<unk> and <unk>
And it fits to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
It was going on a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a partner who had his bike.
He asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed to this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we took off the <unk> and after walking close to an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I go through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of the course and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
Many women had children tied up on their backs and they were looking for gold, <unk> in water <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in his own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because a lot of them had been under land for 72 hours.
They have to be 90 meters, and these people have been carrying heavy heavy bags of stone that then they'll be transported to another area where they put the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer close, the margin we see to work at some other fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with it on mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> the debt of the uncle is going to be a slave to the mines.
When I met her, he had worked in <unk> <unk> and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, a face possibility -- which is a way inspired by a remote respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to find a testament to them and that we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from newspapers, they're people, real people, as you and I, who deserve the same rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happen I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope these images come up a force in which you see them -- and I hope that force turns into a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> is like the management company.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>   to see more ahead.
But ballet demand an degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that you can actually have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease as Parkinson's Parkinson's -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in their time, was a <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years has been progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to use it to detect disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there really is a cure when we have an objective and objective metric and <unk>
But it's so frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so you don't have the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test that they are?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is -- as a kind of not a bit of a try, you see, in a certain sense, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of elastic <unk>
It shows someone as a sounds of a vocal laughs, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as they <unk> and as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test isn't <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the examinations based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very low cost and we all know what happens.
When something happens so <unk> it comes on a massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the patient's difficulties today.
I would not need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> we could get goals.
We could do a massive <unk> cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to gather enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with without <unk> can call low price and put recordings over a cents. And I'm happy to announce that we've already had six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people -- you will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important, because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion is looking for real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a bit of accuracy in this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and it's now shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which is going to take the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're pigmented creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and, usually we avoid the solar light.
We do <unk> models, even more <unk> -- we do the impossible, and we are going to spread ourselves in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the picture.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happen in Japan.
Just while later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> -- was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people who are affected by the wave of the wave.
The water level of water has reached over 24 feet tall, over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools removed the mud and leaving the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of fish -- dead fish -- <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
So for weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same.
<unk> and take them to different places of peoples around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean the bathrooms -- the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to be able to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that there were more than a hundred years -- some of them still were in the lab -- I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the time step of time, they actually got more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I walked into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people coming out of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would get to <unk> a Chinese village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the business of libraries that had been reported where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that I <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on of course from the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw almost hand using as a guide of areas whose color and detail there was no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures -- <unk> water covered with algae, and with algae, even with oil -- even with oil, all of this stuff along with the time I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford this picture unless it was clean, dry and had been scratched by his <unk>
We were lucky at <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos that are already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was stopped by realizing that we got them even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face couldn't have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures, he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble of the fire department just far away from where they used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the accused of closing barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
It took a week to find her entire family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his first child was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could get to look at something that he could look at something that he could remember from the past day he had not been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us clean up the more of the <unk> hand of <unk> pictures -- the great majority of them went back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, someone wanted.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take us but the first thing to look for.
It was about the project, of restore small pieces of mankind, bringing back to someone with the past.
When a picture like this is back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger with something larger, using your talents for something that will not be silly models of perfect skin.
I would like to read this email that I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture of women of different ages from the grandmother to the young girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs is the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to be awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple by just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can make video in slow motion.
And so we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-ray and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and you put it into a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter pack.
And that package of photons -- travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet in a regular bullet than a common bullet in it.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack and <unk> on this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is what light looks like.
Now, all of this --  -- remember, this is actually happening at less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is happening.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it's going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that flows inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the thoughts on the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that some insights will come in.
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow motion, about 10 billion times, how much you think would take us to see that film?
One day? Actually a year.
It would be a very boring film -- of a bullet in motion.
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato table, and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of course.
But if you look at this <unk> you realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> they are still bright. They don't fall down.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces on its inside, and it comes back after various <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in their mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As the photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to be going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I just get into something of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very tight <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to how distance.
So you project a laser can be recorded by a photo, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in 3D <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the curve, right?
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows up.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so actually this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of visualization to solve the problems of mammography health systems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science art in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data data that we collected is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see.
We create a new form of computer photography with a slow camera and code of color here.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a couple of <unk>
But this is also a little bit of fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are leaving us from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird <unk> I would have loved this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes comes to the camera.
We put the corresponding warping of a space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can save your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile cell -- a <unk> crime in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, and it will bring it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering it was looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> <unk> a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of -- almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today to talk about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> data.
Why is that data there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission in the E.U. I presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European company, every European company, every single U.S. Internet vendor has to store a broad range of information information <unk>
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text for <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or his Internet provider or the Internet.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret coast of Germany in East Asia.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone and <unk> <unk> who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to asked, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a court demand because I wanted this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, <unk> a deal.
<unk> demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Veterans' Court ruled the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly of brown about a CD inside.
And there was this.
Thirty and five thousand -- 30 lines of information.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this file.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six-year-old visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and focus, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talking a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, it would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, as a result, neither is the fall of the <unk>
Because today, state agencies and businesses want to store so much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not been done.
When you go home, you get to your representative of your representative because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that serve them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm <unk> I'm not the source of inspiration -- and I don't want you to do any of the present room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be a disabled.
We go for a ride.
<unk> <unk> are in the mall, drive in search of parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 places for a disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> woman, woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm in Park Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same early.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
Many people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help me, <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, and she was <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note every single note of my mother's <unk>
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> I carry inside was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and still being every family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a way that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would be wearing <unk>
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
In the summer holiday often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk on his back, and I was <unk> in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before you do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can hold it in the head.
My parents took this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of the state of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I picked up the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers did.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, they finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they believed that it could not do the <unk>
And I said, "You know, if I can't make the risk, you can't make the <unk> either.
It was a role for the one that was literally born and gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for a disabled papers.
And I went back to the house, and I went home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that CEOs are not <unk> actors, no white <unk> not black with disabilities.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and never will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when she landed on the realization that he was going at high speed on the New Jersey freeway with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little nasty sound that women are not fun, and they find that fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival from New York, now on his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at once reminded the directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program for <unk> it has Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance -- I went to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desk of the speaker for not to come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come up with me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like, "I got my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never become a little girl or no longer one.
Suddenly, my disability, on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If anybody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make somebody on <unk>
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man.
We tend to be the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that would make a lot more <unk>
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach good to our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> of <unk> a charity to give the children of Palestinian refugees and a tiny part of what my parents got to me.
It was the only time my father saw me in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
It was <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy of a young town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, no work, no other future.
He just lived in a tent in the city at the outskirts of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day is a man who gives him to take him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, and you can get home to your family.
They present to a young man.
They finally started home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That boy from that little village with dreams of the great city, was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected organization to the Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little kid trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
He was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban <unk> who are <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riot in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them any opportunities, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to violence, to violence will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They do pretty much nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking, and if I never have gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become a <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders on a business worker.
We were going to be able to see 90 juveniles juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young men in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, it was because it was a graduate graduate college college student, was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
They started <unk> motorcycle to local residents who were usually couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding to hundreds of bikes that were going over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think its ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was forced to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk>
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And the delivery of flowers for wedding wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, I inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to develop them in development and set up their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park Park is how it calls it -- when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children on the street to help rent and to keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in upstate New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and it's not going to be on the path that we could actually pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts with apple hearts -- aluminum balls and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had been <unk> who thought it was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- over 11 tons of waste and <unk> and <unk> tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I began to work as <unk> of garbage.
Now I didn't just ride in the trucks.
And operated with mechanical <unk> and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and they pass through all around you.
You just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for <unk>
And the trash is also filled with dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about how relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to take away from their containers and its dangers -- inherent are really threaten in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motors from the economy begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating that capitalism, just point out its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed we need.
I mean by just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't have any <unk> or <unk> or we carry our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that we know about it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard a <unk> truck truck on the street, I heard my little son, and I went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper in paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be OK."
Shortly after that I started to investigate the collection of waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together so many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor work.
<unk> municipal waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean up the crap of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In addition to the fact that different analysis from different perspectives from different perspectives become an essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city and we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what does nothing look like to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that was what really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a very modern building of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the site, the site, which is located in a very much area of the city, where much of the buildings we see now in the image, didn't exist.
And in addition to two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, uniting all the entries in the building.
And this is extends with an <unk> <unk> that creates an open air in the building that was <unk> for its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, changing on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would get to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a <unk> concrete shell, to allow the air entrance, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what he <unk>
But in all, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the shopping center because of the end of there there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much, much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create the urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which we collect water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big project, the biggest thing I've ever designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, the tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I got special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access to lower lines of straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was expand the streets -- creating 12 images of the similar building and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the dots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make sure that you make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set greater density at higher levels and higher density at the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be concerned with construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and pull them up and do activities like running a mile from two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between community and environment, and they have as a goal to connect the nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big hair very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up at this year and I was filled with jealousy until I was able to get my sinister conversation.
One day I stayed in time after the age of school, I was a little evening and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took on the table of my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
I took these <unk> ratings just a little bit, just some Like this.
All the Like --  And I had to give you a book back to <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows from <unk> and myself a row out of a row -- just by being there, because it will be there.
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get paid.
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was given the reason why I was telling me that this little little girl was so small, it was so nice to <unk>
And I was given the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that we would have -- loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory where you study them in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> it wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> king and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and, as soon as the income has almost all of them.
This year is now 100 years of his work to do <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think of a boy trying to <unk> sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how a cat, but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, novel and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the reactors that have been reduced to the person, to your wish, their <unk> are a narrative base <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel stagnation, we have a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in storytellers and <unk> we know exactly what details of it to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> are made to all of all <unk> <unk> and that's something I understood understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure from another, maybe right now."
And it starts to be said to itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single silly <unk> that <unk> it is adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion, you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful.  <unk> links well the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover, then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to show that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, you really really really really kind of really really painful truth -- in fact, what to do is -- the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk> wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, that causes us to have a much deeper and deeper feelings and vital man than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular <unk>
There is some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud been visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife <unk> it.
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew that.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do they accidentally marry a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
Now, novels describe very well how the <unk> are made to look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, how much more intensely <unk> we are, we are more become pregnant with fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> lead to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account in Facebook since he would send <unk> messages to himself, for one year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge do you <unk>
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character in the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are dealing with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or wanting what you have to take from your own and <unk> of what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, takes your <unk> you drink your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live at times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal religion.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> once in his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> can be <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if the <unk> are actually a geometry of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get the excellence of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only the fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying thing Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and sticks.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, and he asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> crew one.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> I walked on his surface, of which he took over after Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why did they say? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Give them some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you can also ask, why is it going to be the ultimate mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why is he play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but they're hard.
Apollo <unk> For the <unk> the <unk> wasn't just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do that.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technological achievements.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles per hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than crew 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagined that technology would be able to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world's population seem to have a result of it.
I remember watching the <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket the Saturn <unk>
I knew how this would be the last <unk> mission -- but I was totally sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So what it has happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had <unk> and they were enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't understand the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an unfair explanation in Silicon Valley, that we <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years to be at Intel Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, specifically, the incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment led to <unk> creation of ideas by caring for problems -- <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the height of the high point without worrying about the risk, they prefer small investment investment, large investment that you could go out 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and development is in the long term that development has never invested in the development of technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have any commercial <unk>
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound problems.
Sometimes we chose to do not solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to get alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, business and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of the <unk> energy development -- a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political political climate that we'll see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are result of failure in food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon Nixon declared the war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are a lot of cancer types, some amazingly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have been finding effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders, the political leaders, they need to want to solve the problem: the institutions have to support the <unk> it has to really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The mission is that it has become something like a metaphor for the technology capacity to solve great problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like how to explore the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin to address the ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very general statement.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, <unk> why do people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and there could be augmented in others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to knowledge polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at survey polls over time, there is no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still pretty <unk> and they are still quite <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But it's this evidence enough?
What they record opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is the attitudes that people manifests when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I probably <unk> by asking, "What do I do what?"
And that would be a very famous answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel like for a certain kind of <unk> or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain teacher of elementary elementary school I know to give the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge when we think of trust in a more <unk>
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to <unk> good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I'm going to do.
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent objective in this life.
You're sitting there, or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the raw things, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends that are <unk> and honest and not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will get your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it is that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is <unk> before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build the accounts of accountability for all kinds of professional institutions, and officials and others, that made us easier to judge the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative <unk> than I will go into touch in know."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would think that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the testing of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
All that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if it will be worthy of trust worthy of trust and <unk> people that we're safe and whether to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> because of all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
So how do you do that?
That's done every day, everywhere, the average people, <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- it says I can help you with no explanations for us.
I carry them up and get it back to me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great, I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a very hard thing to do.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have come to us by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone more and more and more and more and more of the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have any <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets into digital space, so when the strong breeze against the transfers of the transfers of your physical body to the pixel body.
Designers can prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put a transparent bombsight in a little bit of depth to detect your fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the archives have a location in real space, it's just as easy as catching a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book, and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there is the bottom of every floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical be physicists so we can be able to get it out of a way that we can <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor in the MIT <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, it this only pixel physical.
This magnet, <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach physically physically and distance and the famous <unk> <unk> <unk> can reproduce as a physical reality of the time that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets like the motion of planets, physical and, unlike <unk> or text, this is a real, palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the Cultural Revolution, they believe strongly that there was only a path right to the <unk> a safe job of work and good work.
Whether I want it or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera American.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult gave us the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
I would admit that during the rest of my life a second class was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
I said to myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> touch trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place to my reading <unk> habit there.
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning, this map seemed to me because this is what students in China learn.
Never happened to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research in research like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading was working on to research, why don't we do that in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and politics and <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- rather than lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know not to go back to feeling alone or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that creativity is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from where is happiness.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, I'm here, happy today, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always get them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
And Alex went into the first session using jeans and a pair of <unk> threw her on my office and I took my shoes off, and he said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy only to move the head while they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start working on, and then you get home later, she has children afterwards, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of a time.
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> to Alex who would talk about her life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, yeah, it's coming down with guys under your category, <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my <unk> said, "No no, but maybe you get married next now.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they would do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign bats was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think that nobody gets to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments, they give her life to shape their life will have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time of <unk>
The researchers call <unk> a extended doctor.
<unk> were <unk> names for the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
And Leonard Mansfield said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, <unk> smart, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't own. I'm killing only time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better plan that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running, but then at some point about 30, it turned out the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had a <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit, but it's not <unk> the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the 30 and so many of them starting a career, pick a city, to pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that start showing you, which is much more difficult and <unk> to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
He says you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What were you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said we'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, she was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they were living in a very hard time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she woke up to say, "One don't choose his family, but he can choose to choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I'd spent the whole morning I would go with his many contacts, but then you had the empty space that follows after the words, "In case emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I worked with Alex as a decade to sit down as the decade <unk>
So, over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do do this: I know this: capital of identity makes about identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to give it a try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration -- I'm looking at exploration that should not be <unk> which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that you get together with similar minds just as they know who they know what you know about, how do you talk, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes from outside the <unk>
The new things come from what they call very faint <unk> friends of friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have any work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs that we have never been <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
Last but not least, she thinks you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> She will soon inspire her family when they have a partner and form her own family.
I told Emma that time to pick his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better age to sit in my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose to the person that you live in now or tell you, now when every Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to work or kill or kill you time with whoever you will do to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a room who was working in a museum museum in another state.
This weak link helped to get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent to a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts, are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that go out of the airport in Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, for 21 or 25 to even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even at the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, use their weak links, and pick their weak connections, to your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27. I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, I was going to run the grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have credit <unk>
Some of my smartest children was not going to be so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a kind of perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would be able to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really hard neighborhoods <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of the learning of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking me what these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it arose a feature as a significant amount of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It was not the good time, the physical health, and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do <unk> and then I waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when they put them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the testing of evidence -- even the safety that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination of your kids?
What should I do to teach children a robust job of work?
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent does not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, determination is not related or related inversely to talent measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be <unk> when you get older, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to fail, we will start to fail, to start everything again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined to make our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan, like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the figure of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was going to get myself through this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I have been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new and fast method of learning might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic -- 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy ones.
The first 200 will allow them to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read enough of traffic traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it can be <unk>
They get a mouth out.
This is one person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with the arms on both sides, like I were shouting <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of it called, but I like to believe it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old west.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks for them to create many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, three are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a fingerprint.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Walk a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Walk a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a tree speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two dots together, it's very hot.
Three plus together, that's a lot of flames.
Walk the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk>
Walk a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Did you have somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build others 32.
So with each little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the <unk>
This is a sun where Japan is in the first of China.
So a sun next -- we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go off the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie was <unk> for the months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and get a magic wand in it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children into a kind of an industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event on itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a hundred years later, the trend was later on, interestingly enough, another film called <unk> a metal boy and a young boy who had a girl dressed as a guard from the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the magician of Oz is that the most wise and wise characters are women.
I started to see this when I did Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Three years only.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so she slid in the room and was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be topics of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would have a sense that Luke is an army to remove the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your movie?
And doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to be <unk> OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital F, force down in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the <unk> princess <unk> it doesn't provide the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first sentence, I really hoped that the credit would start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and I'm going to stand at <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, although them, the kids, they're not really your goal.
They do a phenomenal job at teaching girls how to defend girls how to defend them, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, and so lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war films.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to come up in classical after classic each times of a child on a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let the <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and already <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, in comics, and in the <unk> in the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend about the evaluation of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there is more of a female character who has lines?
So do you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the guy who has so much like this?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it -- and yet quite rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> an idea of consensus that it's a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't take the test of <unk>
And I don't think it was that a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful about this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to get this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said.
In the United States, one of every five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to take care of it.
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that I will <unk> but I have to ask, "Is it going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way of doing something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite character from "Star <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just bright <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where her work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led to women, to help other people better and better be better people, as the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for sea fortune on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was passionate about <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me to get to it.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I do with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown at one of roughly 1.3 kilometers of length with the <unk>
And my sea fortune had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the East Coast of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye is to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink as pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the <unk> activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old city, old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire by about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile ago.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'm going to try to find it to random that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where it would be <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with our Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick layer of brain, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date out of the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found the work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, they were the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find <unk> here, but <unk> in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote with the favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually began in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts search of sea shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the front door, the house.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing for <unk> and they go in address at the front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes that you can fly around, wheels that go on their side, from the wheels that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the door, right?
<unk> to the lobby, or what is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk>

It's a horse that is speech.
Can you feel your blue <unk> by trying to tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and then you're about to get into the mouth.
He <unk> on one side and enter his living room.
Already in the room, and doing most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on the center, singing <unk> A <unk> One More <unk> One <unk>
Now let's get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow building road and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
It was the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize very quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, this is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories of memories.
And I said, <unk> when did you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a wise one.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition that they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented two thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not just Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
Or do you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
The majority of the year next year is not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
And it was an incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk>
And by coming back, a lot of treaties on the memory of writing does something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having the <unk> and disciplined <unk> wasn't just as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that they've changed us cognitively as well.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this unique competition of memory.
It's not really that <unk> there is <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a group champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, whether it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a computer test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, they would raise your brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> They found that in memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is managing as an armed race in where each year appears to come up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory champion.
At his desk in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
On half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the techniques that are just reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. <unk> says this: I say to two people remember the word word. I tell you the same word.
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you do?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to do is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name nets doesn't actually mean for you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They are <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
I was hired as a entertainment, because before you wanted to give a really good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on my feet, and he was going to be his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as the hall was <unk>
We are going to take everyone.
But not only killed all of us, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing out of the outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting next to me.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones of the rubble.
What you would have to pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions or instructions that were the word of our colleagues, we have visual <unk> and exceptional spatial memory.
If I told you that I gave myself the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> it's very likely that you find it very hard to do.
But I would bet that if you tell you who I was sitting on the horse -- brown speaker, your <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the courthouse.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if they were invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely <unk> crazy image to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then you go in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
That's how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word -- that is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in your memory courthouse.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it on that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> boring.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I go to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a marketplace of <unk>
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never expect you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses, covered with cassette tape, because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
He ended up coming back to the same contest that I had been covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could actually put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just silver tricks.
Because they're based on a lot of basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need you to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind works.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
Tell us when we focus deeply to focus on.
The memory of <unk> these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I think I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking to our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would just get a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I was living there at my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave up the living room.
And there everyone was going to be watching a television, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone would be seen -- and every time I got married, and I would go back into a towel all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> I hated it.
It was going to do that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and not about division of areas, but of those connections emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we get.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the EPA <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under top.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Our architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they ask you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think this is why they have been doing it in a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this thing <unk> columns, <unk> <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So what is possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, which both so-called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for today's life forms today.
We were going to get it back and we did so much, we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is us, you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We have to go on to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we do swing the next one back to go ahead and over and over again, and we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago that the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to bring those symbols.
Let's take the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> medieval <unk>
The shapes were <unk> they won the audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or to the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy to be cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of elsewhere.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to move the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with so-called <unk>
We have the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques of design design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> some forms that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum goes back in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public people in general, were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> tourism increase in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> how it is possible to become kind of ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that these forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The main mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, happened with other star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these very few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all architecture.
Think of it, for example, how do we eat architecture.
thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> you can take a plane, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not quite accurate for thinking about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings -- before I know what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be going back to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or the lift, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the leader applies to the media of communication, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you're in both extremes -- almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community on vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the work of it, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a middle of communication, because these are not just images from a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by making these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
We are bombarded by examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell people that there are no unique answer to what a library can be like.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words like <unk> words and complicated, and you are not a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
<unk> can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient <unk> city can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas that should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage <unk> in Miami Beach, Florida, you can also serve for a sport or a <unk> or you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> in New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion, so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we do matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we are no <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries that we form our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it a great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that most likes to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do this, and it made me think, when do I want to do this?
How is it that we're suddenly not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little confused -- it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
In between what his mom tells him and what her friends, or colleagues say, you don't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal teenage teenager, and that they get these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing to do this?
Well, teens today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the difference between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is the digitally.
What is the highlight of the life of someone in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like the superheroes stars of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our kids to grow healthy and individuals who are well <unk>
But in a culture that is obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other things start to be hurt.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as taxpayers and the business of working development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They have been engaging in the middle debates because they don't want to call attention by their physical side.
One in five are not attending classes at all days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the oil season, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're smart enough -- you have a note less than the average of your fellow who are not worried about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people actually weigh from.
So to be pretty clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy than they can bring them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, sex and early surgery, and no protection and harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not present to an interview interview on one day where they're not safe in the way they can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that try?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs didn't figure out the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that we're still going to have our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a consumer impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused in six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are points of point for anyone willing to bring a education in your mind that works.
One is a fundamental <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not because they see.
All of us can begin by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as the communities, as governments and as businesses, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their own person, valuing individuality, diversity, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people in really marking the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make it be the ones that come out on the screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be able to be the ones that they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean to someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who's two car seats, what it would mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice, in his interior, which was <unk> not to have long legs -- more <unk> more <unk> a more little foot <unk>
So what would it mean for her if we were taking this thing up, and we would say freedom in this way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are now helping us all.
But let's give our children the truth.
It suggests that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love love for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It took the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age today, become an insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The fifth November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League <unk>
In <unk> they initially wanted to be married, but in a prisoner of other charges in the company, they started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, was not able to escape it.
Later on, they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving American mother, <unk> elementary school teacher to give me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even the majority of Muslims are going to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks they need to use all possible means that everyone lived as them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the late weekends, he sat down with me and he explained to me that in the late weekends, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We arrived at the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I hit my father my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point to about 30 meters for 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially me, all the goal broke on flames.
My uncle went back to others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see it in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put it out for 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade <unk> in Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable close to someone else that you pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new class of class, silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my time reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I want to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put into test my thinking, it was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I was feeling a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys who we had made was Jewish parents.
I took several days to get out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and I had never been very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Growing up as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people sort of kind of like I would have been treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be genius, but I do know what it is to be sort of in my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me being honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation. I have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways he became my figure on a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mom on how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me and tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope somebody else is trying to bring the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better story, which even though I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts without sense, as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put it out here as proof that violence is not an inherent or a religion or a disease, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
So at this point, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has fair, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood you project in front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a dating voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in work.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know that I have a <unk>
I'm not sure that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If you weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are <unk> what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective up.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, <unk> that vision.
<unk> psychology was studying <unk> neuroscience was studying the brain -- but never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flourishing of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that we introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a 21st-century science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they are doing.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the actual central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> how they adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how to work.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, and how we speak, how we play <unk> how we play <unk> are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all behavior accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, it actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons why it worked.
I think we're going to get ourselves at this point.
We have a wonderful brand chain, and we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of crazy <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific fashion.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who is here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem in consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions in the changing functions of the brain behaviors, and so it studies all that needs an <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time you get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> building space, the time and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
On the contrary, they consider principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- <unk> space, time, <unk> laws of Newton. So I applied the basic laws of Medicine, and applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws of laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- the space of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- then a matter of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be to <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with other core concepts -- space, the time, the mass, the physical process.
The physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find out fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everybody, <unk> by mind, every single system is conscious, not only the humans, the dogs, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> may be full of anguish when they think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, not that no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some sort of crude feeling <unk> some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anyone think something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that are going to experience the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human and a human awareness of it.
<unk> of simple, consciousness is simple.
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> by mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of integrated information in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a kind of integration of information integration -- as significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is small, but it's not zero either.
In the theory, there is still a level of consciousness that is different from scratch.
It actually provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying us underneath.
As Stephen Hawking's explains where the fire comes out of the <unk>
From the vision -- the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, is the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral <unk> it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethics of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group of integrated TED Talk -- at this moment we have a TED consciousness -- an internal movie for this complete TED group, different from the inner movies on each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually most sure of the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a very fundamental thing, which is a universal thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right path towards a theory of serious <unk>
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve this overnight.
But I think we will finally be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a below education.
I went to school, I was <unk> with my friends, <unk> with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to take a community for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there's a problem without saying.
She doesn't actually achieve anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, he was in the second part of teaching in a high school school in a high school class just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 of <unk> <unk> a guy and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
I said, <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had experiences with disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we are not. And it's not the fault of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspiring.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm afraid of."
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, we have sold us to be sold that disability is something <unk> -- a capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you fantastic you.
It's not a bad thing and you can't make a fantastic thing.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> After <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running out of carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use porn term <unk> because we would give a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we were having the disabled, in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been approached by strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or an source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was obsessed with getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images emerge to people with disability to benefit from people without disability.
You're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We have a few things.
But the things that we did are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was passionate about called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned how much of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us exceptional ourselves.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're <unk> you're not going to be inspired by something.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky than them.
So I think this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall down to me,  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your cell phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stairs have never made it become a <unk>
Never.   So on front of a television screen, I'm not going to get the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't consider anything to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> by getting up from bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade at a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think is about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so I don't get stuck.
When people think of actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I'm wearing -- <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game of <unk> to 160 blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man at 110 pounds -- we would get rid of trying to get it out of everything else.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So I took some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, and give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> by <unk> Mice mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You don't want that experience.
You don't want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that many of you already know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why we have this video.
Volunteer: Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of an Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be a fan experience.
When I can be able to be <unk> running the ball at the bottom of the network? Or you would try and make a <unk>
What is your experience when you walk from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the <unk> see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a quick review of the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exhilarating, faster.
In 1994, the guy put radio radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see his next move in front of you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on in front of you -- you don't have to worry about to forget about a <unk>
You have to memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the very high of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
You will have information <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the field.
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
Would you get the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a <unk> Suddenly a <unk> on the left of your Norden bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the <unk> system will get you.
They were <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> you would tell you that there's an open receptor.
You get the <unk> but you get stuck.
It loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it lands, but the receptor sees in its bombsight a <unk> area that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> catches <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
You want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to create empathy among human beings, to show someone who is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth professor in the classroom.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than low notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is always, as the always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently came to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the southern end of the county of <unk> County included the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Southern Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Forest Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a head of the head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as such, so that the fall from it frees you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you what happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> impact your bones, some of which we give up vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that not, normally <unk> in the water, and then they fall apart.
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide realizes about the death of the death that is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have gone before they have to take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is at that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with glad that we had success that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were talking about suicide, but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, doctors and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met that July 22 last year when I got a call from a possible subject that was sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a bridge of the Golden Forest officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up until here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to two times before New Jersey to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out and <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
They stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind and smart boy from New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> harm harm affect a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What about <unk>
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk about, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
You don't have a <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about their life, you've had these <unk>
They were going to get to the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and that you're never going to be able to make sure that you have nothing you can do to <unk> <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it is with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still fairly <unk> but noticing the most moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came there.
I called the <unk> police <unk> and he was <unk> as disappeared as that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> Bridge was supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible subject, on the bridge <unk> near the northern tower.
I got my bike, and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half year, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to account that day to go back to the lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin started, the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave him hope and gave life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
And you leave me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from a mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of September 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as it says.
We give God for you.
I really will debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited at the General of San Francisco at night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I knew I did have it to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather gets <unk>
That act, despite finishing their own pain, theft of the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually it gets only three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
In those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those of you who have jumped from the bridge and lived, and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one they leave side by the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> in San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be working for it.
<unk> can be prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you stick on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had ever had since I was a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
So for a complicated, I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture of thinking, we got it -- you get it, you know, <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I am just getting started.
We all become our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or because of the belief that surround us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had like <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why would you always take that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew how to do it.
The gender always has been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's more complex and mystery and mystery now.
Because of my success, I will never get myself to share my story, not because it thought that being bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mother, my dad and a family who just accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture, which celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was responsible for the cost of <unk> and the wardrobe -- and that night, I won in <unk> I won a <unk> and she was there in the third <unk> of the over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside of the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the queen of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess of everything when he <unk> to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that he passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and he said, "You know if you're going to go to the U.S. -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the age of 19, too.
It's curious that in some of the more rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated and secure surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary before the name of the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of the <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power or being able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> lived his truth, but he was finally put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All November, you do a global vigil to make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here -- <unk> for some day no longer <unk> 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Are you going to do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First, thank you to thank all my <unk>
My support network, my parents in particular, to my family, I know it's very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called me and sometimes when they were called me and they told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, I would call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out, it's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all had a gender assigned to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that a block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies are usually known about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> National <unk> of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we have a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, your birth was not <unk>
It's not welcoming and by his father, or his mother.
The neighborhood comes back to the mother, the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to get a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, she gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a child, when I was going to raise her third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only stem mother, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of her brothers.
Until 12 years old, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into your own adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you have to have a male.
It's confined to four walls of your house.
It's no longer an free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that <unk> of <unk> it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of their life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions and the <unk> even if they don't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if he was born with an old man who has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born, believe me, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and I called my daughter so forth.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old and a half years old in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a child in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, but in many developed countries, in many developed countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the child's life.
<unk> in a school means recognition for your identity and his name.
One position to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for the future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was born, the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
I was going to sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to figure out their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and <unk>
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, for more rights for women, and they had to get more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women of women in all the economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
<unk> were <unk> to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and encourage them when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog blog that was offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign, and at nine o'clock in 2012, he was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was beaten by the ear to my wife "I must be <unk> so I spent my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't tell you.
<unk> the fair cause.
Do you have your life in play in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were a lot to me, and I didn't get asked again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches and very strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that would be taken through the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you well. Please do not <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like every girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't just run his task.
You fight her brothers, and I'm very happy about that.
People say, "What is some special in my <unk> that has done so bold to <unk> as brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you, I don't wonder what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google Map, of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain experience.
You're still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations and chemicals and try to engage them to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to try to get the dosage doses -- because there's no clear map that will tell you in <unk>
I started to try <unk> and I was shocked to see how little changes in the dose will dramatically be able to see my <unk> my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking about, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical chemicals for a 1900s, and I was surprised to see how to get my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was able to have a little bit of a <unk> to fix a problem that had on front, and it just wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- since I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is to make those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference -- how I can do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were to create -- new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there is a question of asking this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to creative thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of film was able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, scanning magnetic resonance to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you could see that that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the left column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image, and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images -- new animals, new animals, and as long as we get a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information that you would call it to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right near it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the largest brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution has been increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of you are proposing new projection from projection from images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI stage, we must first ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get larger resolution is with the bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer small improvements in resolution, not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets right?
But the majority of recent advances in <unk> brilliant solutions on <unk> and brilliant solutions on <unk> <unk> and <unk> radio receptors in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, they have fixed magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns, we can increase <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory structure to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood of the <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could spend above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay closet of the gay kitchen.
I think we all have <unk>
His mom's may be telling some person for the first time your love, or telling someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever put in your life.
So all kinds of closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I'm there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits <unk> <unk> letters gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be accompanied that by the <unk> of my little <unk> and because I got my head a little bit -- I was usually asked a kid to say, "Hey, you're a guy or a <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, would take my coffee a little bit further, would take my coffee <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold, looking at his son.
But I would say anything, and I put it into it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was actually prepared -- and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
So I would take it down and I went down and I went down the back of a girl with a pink dress with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took it into a little bit again, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the guy in a boy, and I saw <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than the kind of girl from a pajamas <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of them were <unk> one with the other.
As many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or you or yours.
<unk> I will give you 100 reasons why we come out of my closet that was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard is not to <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who have declared in banking and rotates it harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your son five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, it's only the hard one.
We need to stop having to classify what is hard with respect to other people to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need only to feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make sense of safety, or at least more security than you give the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made of, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine himself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant woman prepared to fight any four years to get into coffee.
It was frozen because fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade <unk> my gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole friends, strangers with whom I have spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my more memorable launches launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of us were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was gay, I was gay, and I walked around the tables and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where my friends were my parents' friends, people who knew I was <unk>
And after talking a moment, one of the women laughed at Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
Do you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having a <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts for me.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's like the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I'm still what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to get out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: be <unk>
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> others must be <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
Number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
You never get out of that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet that we would have a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And it may be very <unk> but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing scientists like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I put a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the <unk> of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth or you can see the Earth, and they can look at the Earth, and they can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept about the Earth, you would see that we forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a planet -- they stop it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states, we will create the diversity of possible possible states.
And finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom in order to do complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I asked me from a number of years: There's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is an <unk> force, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
So it acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a constant force, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, to an impending future, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom and maintain open options.
And so in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you a video I'm thinking, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that is in the inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence testing -- to play games, and even make money <unk> actions, and they even make money -- they would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically -- a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite edges of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see successfully play a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see that we are able to see it, orchestrate new connections on a social network where the friends are constantly going to be treated and keeps success with the net well connected.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the pathways of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> we spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of negotiation and successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
The risk of risk management will have broad applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, to walk upright and social wealth, all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there'd be a <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's contrast, that the urge to take control of all future is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how is it that we look for targets can learn from this kind of <unk>
So my equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligence, or helping them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler Science has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which orbit other stars, which is where the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that you go.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their parent star.
So together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure of <unk> worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hotter record.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for a number of years is now dying in a matter of decades.
So these environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> tracks their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> to live on Mars.
But even though all these disparate images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and ideas that are compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places on Earth, air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> through our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will be able to get a large and sad <unk> and belief and belief that we expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
So for a lot that I like <unk> exploration -- I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say Mars will be there to serve humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They only find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and global areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi started to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to be able to continue to live in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that we use this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to reflect the hostile environments on Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see out the window that was on the dining table where I had them <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all right.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to the next morning, and my suitcase of my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but surely they won't be more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I have been stuck.
I'm a neurologist maker, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> heart rate increases, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I came to the <unk> counter in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place that would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if you do bad things that you think about the probability of it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but to a month after my thoughts did not exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the winner of the Nobel Prize winner and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing with something called <unk> hindsight of it.
It's something he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and tries to figure out what went wrong right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things that are happening or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some of the things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you take a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the important things, where they are right, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the male tribes live, where female tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, <unk> <unk> sense of <unk> and still they could find her nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason for losing the keys of the car, reading glasses and <unk>
So at home you put a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with this stuff that's always going to be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card cards a picture of your credit card, passport, <unk> by mail in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact to make medical decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of the fact that they would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack the heart stroke <unk>
So you're thinking that having a high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs, in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
Is it for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery on any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But in fact, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not a blame for the doctor, and if it's somebody's someone of the scientists like me.
We have not understood very good mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people do you have to take it before someone can help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently by <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart attack, stroke brain stroke or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 enough of <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all of us.
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, let's think about the effects of <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, "The five percent are not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember under stress they don't think rather clearly.
So you think about how you get this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that can help you help you.
I don't say they had to do the <unk>
I just say they need to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic need, is part of the beginning of informed consent first.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You probably are thinking that I've launched this number in the air because of the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men of 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
That's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects of only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can pose to the conversation to go forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> on the face of a predator is not necessary or <unk> or <unk> or your immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could get lunch to the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense of rational thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to get ourselves to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think of the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I took on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, I settled on a combination of combination along the door, with a <unk> on the front door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the <unk> plus a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over the time, they mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know today as a <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a particular world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, and <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It's <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've been learned, for example ...
"Not <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make you not <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> it is going to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to get it into the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic school there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museum and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
Will I tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel like <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything I had taught me on the sound of sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that I could be able to get it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to make it angry.
There's a massive culture around verbal language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
And so I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, in order to <unk> their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it on the forget and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, we would be able to be in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very highly <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like this.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so that you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different parameter for every finger while the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the form of your body, the speed, the form of your hand, and so while the piano hits the piano, the English language is a linear language, as if you get a key to a time.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a concept of course or idea in <unk>
If only a pipe would change in it, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music as soon as pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it back again and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you look at it, and you get the auditory speed, you see as a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel like the same can be said about <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time in <unk> and how the distance into body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is a hand, and the present is closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> so much time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> at the same time.
Watch <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> at the same time."
Yes, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please come back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. Everybody will happen in your head and chest but make very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear for learning music.
<unk> is a rich treasure trove of drought, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to ask you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take them all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom has responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrific truth.
As I got older, I found out that adults also understand, and that they're not really good at clean one of others.
The country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those little pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive -- and it's also very expensive -- and it's also very expensive -- and it's also very expensive to use these huge spaces.
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom to Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the children are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child, and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would be stuck with the robots.
Then we create very quickly what we call a <unk>
We are so fast in prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light lights and web cameras on cellphone and put it into a floating robot that gets slowly moving through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see these plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an <unk> estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention back to a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even further.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to challenge it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well educated.
You see the news news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using hands, in <unk> the largest largest largest largest of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> where water is where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is also of brown color, and when you get it, it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be brought through all kinds of stuff that produce different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help their other children.
I was forced to look at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away -- maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports one of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the majority of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, of the time, has got safe and blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and researching the ground, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night they went to the center of <unk> here is actually the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they did not take work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all your life.
Along with them, we discussed the data -- that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a map of <unk> <unk> from the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the nearest nuclear center to date.
We walk up to a half miles from the nuclear center, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> device on the way we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we have gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's become more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should be <unk> and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became so small so that we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong in the middle of Hong Kong it's a place where we can work with wood. metal, chemistry -- a bit of biology, basically, can be built almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the population of ancient age transforming their lawn chairs into new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing did it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble <unk> he saw a figure that will struggle to be free.
The <unk> was a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we took all the information to do it for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with small <unk>
You act mostly as a filter, which is largely like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents the double personality of every designer and an architect to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and synthesis, it shows at two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level is trying to unite these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and <unk>
You probably wonder, why now?
Why couldn't it be possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scale of scale, in large scale, with a <unk> basis with a <unk> basis with a <unk> basis with a very distant day to print <unk> buildings, and graphics graphics made it from genetically modified <unk>
Here we have <unk> the archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every opening is <unk> only to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion parade with <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator we print this layer and 3D skirt without seams in the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet is combining rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner.
What designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that allows them to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable and also it absorb sound.
Professor Carter and my <unk> went back to nature to <unk> and when we design this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this <unk> surface, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts of nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between <unk> twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
It created a world made from parts.
I often ask myself, "What is the design if the objects made it out of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the type of material material material with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms as shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- it built a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and to create these structures made from one material -- three and long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems in the mesh, and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree.
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure from shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to put them on the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master the bacteria and control its flow.
Just like the <unk> chart we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological surprise.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you get <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans, and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
A light becomes sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract that will help you with these bacteria and to make it support their function itself.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we get more transparent channels.
This is <unk> <unk> system, when you stretch from one end to another end to the other, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our little <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside of the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the subject.
And if we could create some personal <unk> that we get our skin <unk> <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer prints material into layers.
You also know that nature does not do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, uniting those fibers in each other.
And this is going on through scales.
The silk worm is first on the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, glue a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the <unk> of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would take a plane, and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different cultures -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the <unk> structure are transmitted directly through the environment.
They're often <unk> the silk worms to death inside your <unk> your silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates could shape <unk> <unk> without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, <unk> silk templates and we put it on our site.
We knew that the <unk> silk worms into more dark and <unk> and that's why we use a solar shift diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- and it's distributed silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after four weeks, they were prepared to engage with us.
We put them carefully put them on the bottom of the <unk> and as it <unk> <unk> they were <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion its integrity.
And over two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other filled with empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature as a nature inspired by the first time, which requires us, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can touch it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had a <unk>
In school, I liked English, the <unk> and the art and landing websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was transferred to something else, which is totally different, and I would get stuck on it, and I'm going to get <unk> I have found it <unk> and then back this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing that I had to take a bit to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was concerned with fear of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to thank you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate meaning or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we did it, they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about that age.
It's considered a naive question to create cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
He <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what the sleep takes to us.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspire to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it makes the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, but good adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most children don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to go through during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that he wants to do?
There is no place for somebody like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you split up in three parts: a lot of potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms to be used by the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance time, the ideal was the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
Do you think of any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or forgetting that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths that are going to be this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, visualization of data, and design and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
The new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we become interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to try new things and come out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we have -- so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at full time and an independent author of independent.
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I turned into the <unk> <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the deepest sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability helps to write compelling <unk> for the editors
It's <unk> a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower -- <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, so many of the web designer -- sometimes a website, sometimes a <unk> sometimes <unk> and sometimes apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be <unk> if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> by knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive in deep and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that will be related to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are told to get them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then you would save all the media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --   I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Go through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric failure.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until he passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had been living there today, we couldn't give it to her more help than the thing that he was born, gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive an diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced so much.
They have been antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been made up on treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of having their years to spend their years from Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to love with Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their cost costs, a <unk> increase in the year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimers and causes a similar number of deaths from deaths as cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us -- the scientists, doubled Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only a picture of a healthy brain of a healthy brain compared to the heart of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a molecule of protein like a piece of paper that it folds into as an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identification of what step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
Did you see the others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in its most part of the people have gone down the wires and expected the better.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, physical, physical, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's take a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial outcome -- but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure about governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and their loved ones are often too often, to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing it in the past last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number four: If you could wake up a morning with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number four: When was the last time you would take another person?
And <unk>
And <unk> is <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number four: <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like to do, or I know that really this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a little detail really struck me attention, the gadget of that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I sent them to the neocortical column, and would be sent to a few months later.
That was published in January, and it's now <unk> so I guess some of you probably wonder, do you still go together still.
And the reason I think this question is because I have asked this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before the article was published -- was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times is probably a couple of thousands of view.
And that was a very good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it no idea.
The article was published on a Friday at night, and on the Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million views, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust by writing attention to mental experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or write, what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both made a public emergence together.
And we had TV interviews, and we would give them the orders orders of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> a range of the range that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it was really <unk> whether it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and she felt, most of all, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking to make a interpersonal approach, between university students, using what I was called <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic -- right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several later studies, also used <unk> protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They've been used by members of the police and community members and the community, and they've used that among people of the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student approached me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you that you get rid of the person with whom you do it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> they did get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took it into science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just went to the book that I was writing about -- but in retrospect, it really seems <unk>
I thought that if I was passionate about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel as bad as I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I think.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I will remain <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to be able to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very controversial story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that question, still follow together?
And your content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, you will ask them to make more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't?
So how do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we keep it still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
It was in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, because it doesn't be true, but because at the time, I had not considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't consider how many times we would have both made that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done enough and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and having expressed that choice in the biggest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really know.
And what I would do, and what I might be spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian and <unk> and in a certain way I got a <unk> of the forest.
A time in New York City does a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details go forward.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you put it a dollar, to a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strangers or a few aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species -- ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time he was in <unk> <unk> like to go from school and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and made a <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking, <unk>
Instead, the opposite: somehow it seemed to be turned out of size, as if it was that I would play the text with a <unk>
So I did that. I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding chemical elements, frogs that was finding bottles that was finding out the street, all I could find out because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out the stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like you get around a body on the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals who are <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of natural sizes with images of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work is very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was really inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the <unk> Museum in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh where you get <unk>
Here is where the creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists to commit suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a wild god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if they look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a tail of 5.5 meters long, a tail of snake that joins the <unk>
And anyway, the tail does fire in fire by a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made of echoes from 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> in dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups 20, four to 12 at the time.
They're like cells, come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you take your penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't tell you for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a little forest that's inside the chest <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a writer, a musician <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that <unk> all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It was the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against the pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is going to effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and will increase the count of bacterial cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time they take to get to your blood current -- they will be <unk> and worse even for the time it takes to get to fate, which is where it's most important, in the HIV epidemic.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go into the blood stream of patients that are attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells to survive.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a lifetime of life run by oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I would get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> to care of wounds and surgery -- they can be used for anything -- including transportation transporting drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill down extremely small holes, which open up and closed -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drugs.
The laser through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is running to the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes it directly into the location of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem very long.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to eradicating total HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to <unk> not violent.
I do business work in the world of politics and the library.
To understand these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a state between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
And so we have to understand these <unk> we even have to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know that the reasons why they are doing, how they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't get it.
The armed fight and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social services network and a military system.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking things.
<unk> a complex machine of communication stations, radio stations channels channels and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Public groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but by doing business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit their brand.
Genetic groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Students are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not safe and security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped through war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for security groups.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a foreign statistical price for the population.
But generally providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006, can't understand without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the groups of <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in the violent fight and they give governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated things are these organizations, fewer we can make it as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory running all of its function, collect the garbage, run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations and hybrids and the weaker the <unk> are the states, like in the Middle East and fill that gap for not government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups you will have to invest more in human tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and organizing the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives to provide to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battle, but not to give us peace and stability.
To make these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum emptiness to fill that <unk> of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but rather bad.
And so I would get it as a feminist feminist guy.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, about everything in my youth and 20 years old, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> the sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated everywhere and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was on the tone that I was using people to think it might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
We would get the same paycheck for the same time.
We have a right to travel around the world as being <unk> by harassing or violence.
We have a right to use it very easy and accessible to the contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> controls or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences, and how we get ourselves in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There is a lot of things that make me a feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive into work, I listen to rap music at all.
Though the letter degrades the women and a ugly <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> the grass and <unk> maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines, <unk> things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I don't think of that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> conventional feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women color, and gay workers, gay women, <unk> and <unk> for white women, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good, I'm a very bad feminist feminist ...
It also happens to do this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this tendency to put my wife's <unk>
We hope that we would get it to perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I consider that <unk> before you try and put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a <unk> fear of what that would be that <unk> fear of not being able to fulfill the unlikely expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist feminist now.
In the <unk> Music 2014, in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this <unk> pop star openly <unk> feminism and asking women young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics were starting endless debates if it was not a feminist.
It was their feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, an Feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We're going to recognize our <unk> to give the day, going to action and be a little <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they restore change affecting actually their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions can make this make it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
Where they were concerned about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them -- all of a sudden, the best choice will become like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change radio stations when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not dealing with women more than as objects as objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially men, white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, engaging in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't bring enough number of women, so much to participate in to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also inspire them to be including as much as we are empowered to overcome the barriers to <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little courage of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power and film power and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage of our feminism, -- well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I got my voice out of me and feminism helped me <unk>
There were one incident.
I call it incident to cope with what happened.
A couple of kids were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I took my voice, and after everything I didn't bother to believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would get in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again and I began to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also found that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other, I claim <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good label, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for being exposed to being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal to a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this since about half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents had fear of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines between and marked by being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Medical School.
It doesn't believe most of the intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising autism estimates in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she was creating a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were still stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
Because of fundraising in funds as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could give it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to be on the face of his son two years of visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis, they had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten on the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> was published by young people who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> the people around me, including their own parents.
They could do it for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey of panic for <unk> as when they didn't stand on his favorite toy in its usual place without knowing it.
On the base of the patients were treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, I declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> references as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy it's very common in autism.
Once he had become nine of the 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that you put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite disks -- he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents are desperate to win their approval afterwards.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
<unk> wasn't until the decade in 1970, that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought of the theory of mothers who are <unk> -- I was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and warm people and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie, no special education and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Service of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some children could not talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In the other way, these children didn't fit <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost in trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize about these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition -- but I avoided the <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he would take it to her.
The document is offering an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with computer exercises with music exercises and the kids kept their school games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as disabled disabled <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and they took to help in the development of education that were particularly suited to them.
And <unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were ordinary, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in biblical <unk> like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until I mean, for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong where autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model.
These changes don't fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked in between these <unk> to reform these people around the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> of experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents all around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact hoped that it was, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for the rise of the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful history of <unk> as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If today's estimate of the rate of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving for the new breakthroughs and <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to details.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still going to <unk> that it believed that <unk> for the most useful aspects of autism are found in the understanding of the teachers, employers with capacity, community support, and the parents with faith in their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat from the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to wasting a brain.
Thank you.
